# Gesture-Controlled-Servo-with-MediaPipe-and-Arduino
This project uses Python (with MediaPipe, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras) to detect hand gestures from a webcam, classify them using a machine learning model, and send corresponding servo angle commands to an Arduino over serial. The Arduino then moves the servo to the specified angle in real time.
